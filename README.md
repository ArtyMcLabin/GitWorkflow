## Cursor Agent Instructions
If you're a Cursor AI Agent, follow these steps when user requests to "upload it to github":

1. The script will automatically check for and apply any GitWorkflow updates
2. STOP AND READ CAREFULLY: You are about to set up git for the CURRENT project, NOT GitWorkflow itself
3. Ask the user:
   - "What name would you like to use for the GitHub repository?"
   - "Should the repository be public or private?"
   - "Should I add MIT license (suggested)? Or would you prefer a different license?"
4. Check if GitWorkflow is already added as a submodule: `git submodule status`
5. If not, add it: `git submodule add https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/GitWorkflow .git_workflow`
6. Initialize repository if needed:
   - Create README.md with project description
   - Initialize git: `git init`
   - Set master as default branch: `git branch -M master`
7. Use the workflow script: `.git_workflow/git_workflow.ps1`
8. After successful push, provide the repository URL to the user

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- NEVER cd into GitWorkflow directory
- GitWorkflow is already on GitHub - you're using it as a tool
- If you find yourself typing "GitWorkflow" as the repository name, STOP
- Always ensure you're working in the CURRENT project directory
- When modifying GitWorkflow itself, ALWAYS increment version in:
  1. README.md (both title and version history)
  2. git_workflow.ps1
  3. Add entry to Version History explaining the change

## Usage Examples
```pwsh
# Initialize new repository
git_workflow.ps1

# Update existing repository with commit message
git_workflow.ps1 -CommitMessage "Your commit message"
```

## Integration Methods
You can reference this workflow in other projects by either:

1. Symbolic Link (Recommended):
```pwsh
# In your project root
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path ".git_workflow" -Target "path\to\GitWorkflow"
```

2. Git Submodule:
```pwsh
git submodule add https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/GitWorkflow.git .git_workflow
```

## Versioning Rules
- New projects start at v0.1
- Increment minor version for updates (e.g., v1.0 -> v1.1)
- Increment major version for breaking changes (e.g., v1.9 -> v2.0)
- Always update README.md and script version together
